        <li>Prompt the user to enter a time between 1 to 60</li>
        <li>
          Using DOM Manipulation, create a timer displaying the value input as
          the time in minutes, and ‘00’ as the time in seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create two buttons: the start button and the reset button
          <ul>
            <li>
              The start button starts the timer. Using asynchronous JS, create a
              loop where the value of the time in seconds decrements by 1 every
              second. If the time in seconds is at 0 and there is still time
              remaining in minutes, decrement the time in minutes by 1, and set
              the time in seconds to 59. Repeat until the timer reads 00:00,
              after which the user will be alerted that the time is up.
            </li>
            <li>
              The reset button sets the time in minutes and the time in seconds
              to 0.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
